Project Overview:
In this project, I've been entrusted with developing an advanced inventory program tailored for our growing manufacturing organization. Our existing manual data entry method needs an upgrade, and I'll be building a JavaFX-based application to streamline our inventory management. The goal is to ensure that the application matches the provided GUI mock-up and adheres to the UML class diagram while meeting our specific business needs.

Primary Goals:

I. Crafting the User Interface:

My task involves creating a robust JavaFX application that faithfully follows the layout presented in the GUI mock-up.
I'll design forms for various functions, including Main, Add Part, Modify Part, Add Product, and Modify Product.
It's essential to provide comprehensive Javadoc comments, explaining any error corrections and suggesting potential enhancements for the future.
II. Developing the Application Logic:

I'll need to build a set of classes that align with the elements outlined in the UML class diagram.
Incorporating concepts such as inheritance, abstract/concrete classes, and managing instance/static variables/methods will be integral to the development process.
Main Form:

One of my key objectives is to create a seamless experience for adding, modifying, and deleting parts and products.
I need to develop a mechanism for searching parts/products using either ID or name, with the ability to highlight or filter results.
Including a functional Exit button is crucial to provide users with a smooth way to close the application.
Part Forms:

For the Add Part Form:

I'll need to tailor radio buttons based on the user's choice (In-House/Outsourced).
Ensuring that unique part IDs are generated automatically while disabling the ID field.
Capturing comprehensive part details, saving the input, and guiding the user back to the Main form.
As for the Modify Part Form:

My task is to populate text fields with the existing part data.
I'll also ensure the proper adjustment of radio buttons while retaining the part ID.
Enabling users to modify part details, saving changes, and smoothly transitioning back to the Main form are integral.
Product Forms:

In the Add Product Form:
I'll automate the generation of unique product IDs while disabling the ID field to prevent unwanted changes.
Gathering comprehensive product details, associating relevant parts, and securely saving the information.
After successful data entry or choosing to cancel, I'll ensure a seamless return to the Main form.
Regarding the Modify Product Form:
My responsibility is to populate relevant fields with existing product data and their associated parts.
I'll work on enabling smooth modifications to product details, allowing associations/disassociations of parts, and securely saving changes.
My focus will be on ensuring a seamless transition back to the Main form after saving or canceling.
Error Management:

My approach involves implementing meticulous input validation and logical checks using intuitive UI dialog boxes.
This will encompass various scenarios, such as managing min/max values, handling part-product relationships, and confirming user actions.
