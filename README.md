  <h1>Project Overview</h1>
  <p>
    This project involves developing an advanced inventory program for a growing manufacturing organization. Using JavaFX, the goal is to create an application that streamlines inventory management, matching provided GUI mock-ups and adhering to the UML class diagram while meeting specific business needs.
  </p>
  <h2>Primary Goals</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Crafting the User Interface:</h3>
      <p>
        Create a robust JavaFX application following the GUI mock-up layout. Design forms for Main, Add Part, Modify Part, Add Product, and Modify Product. Provide comprehensive Javadoc comments and ensure future enhancements are suggested.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Developing the Application Logic:</h3>
      <p>
        Build classes aligned with the UML class diagram, incorporating concepts such as inheritance and managing variables/methods. Focus on seamless operations for adding, modifying, and deleting parts and products. Implement a search mechanism and an Exit button.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Error Management:</h3>
      <p>
        Implement meticulous input validation and logical checks using intuitive UI dialog boxes. Handle scenarios such as managing min/max values and part-product relationships.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Main Form</h2>
  <p>
    Create a seamless experience for adding, modifying, and deleting parts and products. Develop a search mechanism, highlighting or filtering results, and include a functional Exit button.
  </p>
  <h2>Part Forms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Add Part Form:</h3>
      <p>
        Tailor radio buttons based on user choice, automatically generate unique part IDs, and capture comprehensive part details.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Modify Part Form:</h3>
      <p>
        Populate fields with existing part data, retain part ID, enable modifications, and ensure a smooth transition back to the Main form.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Product Forms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Add Product Form:</h3>
      <p>
        Automate generation of unique product IDs, gather comprehensive product details, and associate relevant parts.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Modify Product Form:</h3>
      <p>
        Populate fields with existing product data and associated parts, enable modifications, and ensure a seamless transition back to the Main form.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
